Last time we solved the motion of two bodies numerically from an *inertial* reference frame.

Now we introduce the notion of the center of mass or *barycenter* of the system, which is just a sort of weighted average of the positions.

$$
{\bf R}_\mathrm{COG} = \frac{m_1 {\bf R}_1 + m_2 {\bf R}_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

It follows that the velocity and acceleration are:

$$
\begin{align}
{\bf \dot{R}}_\mathrm{COG} &= \frac{m_1 {\bf \dot{R}}_1 + m_2 {\bf \dot{R}}_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\
{\bf \ddot{R}}_\mathrm{COG} &= \frac{m_1 {\bf \ddot{R}}_1 + m_2 {\bf \ddot{R}}_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\
\end{align}
$$

Since the only force we consider here is the gravitational attraction between the masses, we found previously that ${\bf F}_{12} = -{\bf F}_{21}$, so substituting ${\bf F} = m {\bf \ddot{r}}$:

$$
m_1 {\bf \ddot{R}}_1 + m_2 {\bf \ddot{R}}_2 = 0
$$

So we see that {${\bf \ddot{R}}_\mathrm{COG} = 0$}, i.e. the barycenter is not accelerating, and is therefore an inertial reference frame.
