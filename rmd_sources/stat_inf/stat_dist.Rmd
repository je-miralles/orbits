***

Discrete variables with two outcomes. Success/failure, such as coin flips.

For a single trial, the [Bernoulli distribution][1]:

$$
P(X = x) = f(x;p) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x}
$$
For $x$ successes out of $n$ trials, the [Binomial distribution][2]:

$$
P(X = x) = f(x; n, p) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}
$$

Properties:

- $E(X) = p$
- $Var(X) = p(1 - p)$
- $p(1) = p$
- $p(0) = 1 - p$

***

Continuous real-valued variables, the [normal distribution][3]:

$$
P(X = x) = f(x; \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e ^{-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$

Properties:

- $E(X) = \mu$
- $Var(X) = \sigma^2$
- with $\mu = 0, \sigma = 1$, it's called a standard normal
- 1, 2, 3, standard deviations contain 68% 95% 99% of density
- $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$ has $\mu = 0, \sigma = 1$

***

Time between independent events with a consistent average rate, the [exponential distribution][4]:

$$
P(X = x) = f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{- \lambda x}
$$
Properties:

- $E(x) = \frac{1}{\lambda}$
- $Var(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$

***

For given number of independent events with a consistent average rate occurring in a fixed time, the [Poisson distribution][5]:

$$
P(X = x) = f(x; \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{- \lambda}}{x!}
$$

Properties:

- $E(X) = Var(X) = \lambda$
- if $n$ is large and $p$ is small, a Poisson with $\lambda = n p$ approximates a binomial
